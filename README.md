# Profit-and-Loss-Statement-Financial-Analysis

## Project Overview
As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance our financial oversight and performance evaluation, we are initiating a project focused on  analyzing the Profit and Loss (P&L) statements across our six branches, in South-South Nigeria, over the four-year period from 2020 to 2023. This analysis will provide valuable  insights into our financial activities and help inform strategic decisions moving forward. 

## Objective 
to analyze P&L data to understand revenue, expenses, and overall profitability across our branches. By the end of this project, we expect to have a clear picture of each branch's financial health and actionable insights to improve performance. 

## Data Structure
The dataset I will be working with includes the following columns:
1. Date: the date of the financial transaction.
2. Branch: The name of the branch where the transaction occurred.
3. Account Category: The category of the account(e.g., Revenue, Expense).
4. Account Name: The specific account associated with the transaction (e.g., Salaries, Loan, Income).
5. Amount (NGN): the monetary amount of the transaction, in Nigerian Naira.


### To Calculate Gross Profit 
- Gross Profit Formula is
- Gross Profit = Revenue − Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
    - ₦8,945,729,507.00 - (-₦3,712,506,264.00
- (Note: This is negative, so when subtracted, it will effectively add to the Revenue).
- Gross Profit =  ₦8,945,729,507.00 + ₦3,712,506,264.00
- Gross Profit= ₦12,658,235,771.00
  
### To Calculate Operating Profit Formula (EBIT)
- Operating Profit (EBIT) = Gross Profit − Operating Expenses − Depreciation and Amortization
  - Steps taken;
- Start with Gross Profit ₦12,658,235,771.00
- Subtract Operating Expenses -₦699,197,468.00
- Gross Profit − Operating Expenses =  ₦12,658,235,771.00 - (-₦699,197,468.00) =  ₦13,357,433,239.00
- Subtract Depreciation and Amortization FROM  ₦13,357,433,239.00
- ₦13,357,433,239.00 −(−₦183,157,267.00) = 13,357,433,239.00+183,157,267.00= 13,540,590,506.00
- Operating Profit = ₦13,540,590,506.00

  ### To Calculate Net profit
  - Net Profit:
  - Formula: Net Profit = Operating Profit - Other Expenses + Other Income
      - Steps
- Start with operating Profit ₦13,540,590,506.00
- Add Other Income(e.g. Dividend Income, Exchange Loss/Gain, Interest Income, Gain/Loss on Sales of Asset)  ₦337,198,885.00
- Therefore; Operating Profit + Other Income=13,540,590,506.00+337,198,885.00=13,877,789,391.00
- Subtract Other Expenses(e.g. Interest Expense, Taxation) -₦169,499,424.00
- Net Profit=13,877,789,391.00−(−₦169,499,424.00)=13,877,789,391.00 + 169,499,424.00
- Final Net Profit = ₦14,047,288,815.00

 ### To Calculate Operating Margin
 - Operating Margin is a profitability ratio that measures the percentage of revenue that remains after covering operating expenses, excluding interest and taxes
 - Formula: Operating Margin = Operating Profit(EBIT) /Revenue * 100
 - Operating Marin = ₦13,540,590,506.00 / ₦8,945,729,507.00 = 1.513
 - Multiplied by 100
     - = 1.513 * 100
 - Operating Margin= 1.513 × 100= 151.3%
   
#### Interpretation of Operating Margin:
An operating margin of 151.3% indicates that the Operating Profit (EBIT) is more than one and a half times the Revenue, which seems very high and might be an unusual figure. This could suggest that the operating costs (such as COGS, depreciation, or operating expenses) are very low compared to revenue, or that there might be some other specific factors affecting the calculation.
    
 ### To Calculate Net Profit Margin
 - Net Profit Margin is a profitability ratio that shows what percentage of revenue remains after all expenses (including operating expenses, interest, taxes, and other expenses) have 
 been deducted. It is calculated by dividing Net Profit by Revenue.
 - Formula: Net Profit Margin = Net Profit/ Revenue * 100
 - ₦14,047,288,815.00/ ₦8,945,729,507.00 = 1.571
 - Net Profit Margin= 1.571 × 100 = 157.1%
 - Therefore, Net Profit Margin: 157.1%

Interpretation:
A Net Profit Margin of 157.1% suggests that your Net Profit is more than one and a half times your Revenue, which is highly unusual. This indicates that the company's expenses (including operating expenses, interest, taxes, etc.) are extremely low relative to the revenue, or there might be other extraordinary income or factors influencing this figure.

### To Calculate Cost of Goods Sold Ratio(COGS) 
- Cost of Goods Sold Ratio shows the proportion of revenue that is spent on producing goods or services
- Formula: COGS Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold(COGS)/ Revenue * 100
