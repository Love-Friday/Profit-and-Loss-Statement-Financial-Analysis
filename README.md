# Profit-and-Loss-Statement-Financial-Analysis

## Project Overview
As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance our financial oversight and performance evaluation, we are initiating a project focused on  analyzing the Profit and Loss (P&L) statements across our six branches, in South-South Nigeria, over the four-year period from 2020 to 2023. This analysis will provide valuable  insights into our financial activities and help inform strategic decisions moving forward. 

## Objective 
to analyze P&L data to understand revenue, expenses, and overall profitability across our branches. By the end of this project, we expect to have a clear picture of each branch's financial health and actionable insights to improve performance.
