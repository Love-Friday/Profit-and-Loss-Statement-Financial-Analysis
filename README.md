## Project Overview
As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance our financial oversight and performance evaluation, we are initiating a project focused on  analyzing the Profit and Loss (P&L) statements across our six branches, in South-South Nigeria, over the four-year period from 2020 to 2023. This analysis will provide valuable  insights into our financial activities and help inform strategic decisions moving forward. 

## Objective 
to analyze P&L data to understand revenue, expenses, and overall profitability across our branches. By the end of this project, we expect to have a clear picture of each branch's financial health and actionable insights to improve performance. 

## Data Structure
The dataset I will be working with includes the following columns:
1. Date: the date of the financial transaction.
2. Branch: The name of the branch where the transaction occurred.
3. Account Category: The category of the account(e.g., Revenue, Expense).
4. Account Name: The specific account associated with the transaction (e.g., Salaries, Loan, Income).
5. Amount (NGN): the monetary amount of the transaction, in Nigerian Naira.


### To Calculate Gross Profit 
Gross Profit Formula is
Gross Profit = Revenue − Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
    ₦8,945,729,507.00 - (-₦3,712,506,264.00
(Note: This is negative, so when subtracted, it will effectively add to the Revenue).
Gross Profit =  ₦8,945,729,507.00 + ₦3,712,506,264.00
**Gross Profit=12,658,235,771.00**

**Operating Profit Formula (EBIT)**:
Operating Profit (EBIT) = Gross Profit − Operating Expenses − Depreciation and Amortization
I'll calculate by step by step to enable any reader understand these mathematical concept. 
Gross Profit − Operating Expenses =  ₦12,658,235,771.00 - (-₦699,197,468.00) =  ₦13,357,433,239.00 
Therefore, Operating Profit (EBIT)= ₦13,357,433,239.00 −(−₦183,157,267.00)=13,357,433,239.00+183,157,267.00=13,540,590,506.00







                          =12,658,235,771.00−(−₦699,197,468.00)=12,658,235,771.00+699,197,468.00=13,357,433,239.00
